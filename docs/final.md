## Abstract
In Spectra, we set out to model the iridescent effects seen in thin films and soap bubbles by simulating the physical behavior of light at the wavelength level. To achieve this, we extended our existing ray tracer from Homework 3 to support spectral rendering, enabling it to process and track light across a continuous range of wavelengths instead of traditional RGB values. Spectral ray tracing is more physically accurate because light in the real world is composed of a spectrum of wavelengths, not discrete red, green, and blue components. This allowed us to more easily capture wavelength-dependent interference patterns and color shifts that are characteristic of thin films. We implemented models for thin-film interference based on Fresnel equations and optical path differences, integrating them into the ray tracing pipeline. The final result is a physically informed renderer capable of producing realistic and visually rich simulations of phenomena like bubbles, oil slicks, and other interference-based effects.
